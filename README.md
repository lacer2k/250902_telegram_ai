## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or later recommended)
- A Google Gemini API key.
  - Get one at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Local Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set API Key:** The application reads the API key from a server-side `API_KEY` environment variable. Set this variable in your terminal before starting the server.
    - **Linux/macOS:**
      ```bash
      export API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
      ```
    - **Windows (Command Prompt):**
      ```bash
      set API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
      ```
    - **Windows (PowerShell):**
      ```bash
      $env:API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
      ```

3.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    - This will start the server on `http://localhost:8080`. Open this URL in your browser.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment on Cloud Run

This application is structured for easy deployment on container-based services like Google Cloud Run.

1.  **Containerize:** Create a `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies (`npm install`) and defines the start command (`npm start`).
2.  **Configure Port:** The server listens on the port defined by the `PORT` environment variable, defaulting to `8080`. Cloud Run automatically provides a `PORT` variable, so the server will work without extra configuration.
3.  **Set Secret:** When deploying to Cloud Run, configure the `API_KEY` as a secret environment variable in your service configuration. The Node.js server will automatically pick it up and securely provide it to the frontend.

###  Architectural Notes

- **Secure API Key Handling:** To prevent exposing the Gemini API key in the browser, a simple Node.js/Express backend is included. Its sole responsibilities are to serve the static frontend files and provide the API key (read from a server-side environment variable) to the client via a secure API endpoint. This is a best practice for web applications using sensitive keys.
- **Decoupled Services:** The application logic is separated from the UI. Services like `geminiService.ts` and `userService.ts` handle all external communication. This makes the code easier to test and maintain.
- **Mock Backend:** The `userService.ts` simulates asynchronous API calls to a database using `localStorage` for persistence for user settings. This makes it straightforward to integrate a real backend in the future by simply updating the service file.
